The AI-Powered Traffic Signal Control System is an intelligent traffic management solution that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision to dynamically adjust traffic lights based on real-time vehicle density, reducing congestion and improving road efficiency.
AI-powered Signal Control: Dynamically adjusts traffic light timings to optimize flow.

Congestion Reduction: Minimizes waiting time by adapting to real-time traffic conditions.

Scalable & Flexible: Can be deployed at multiple intersections for a coordinated response.
